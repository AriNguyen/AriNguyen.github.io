In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a hot domain that draws lots of attention from researchers and investors. From 2010 to 2021, the total number of AI publications doubled, growing from 162,444 in 2010 to 334,497 in 2021. The industry also sees a similar trend as a lot of money has been pouring into AI-related businesses. In 2020, the total global investment in AI reached 67.9 billion USD, an increase of 40% compared to 2019. 

AI is a promising domain as it can help solve current problems and accelerate other non-tech industries. What excites me about AI is the potential to make things easier for humans, such as helping to predict cancer, growing more crops, and optimizing water usage. Many computer science students are excited about AI's potential and want to get their feet wet. And so am I. 

Eager to learn more about this exciting new domain, I've decided to take different initiatives: attending hackathons, volunteering in research labs, building side projects, getting online certificates, etc. While navigating my way to self-teach myself, I discover that there are tons of resources to learn the fundamentals and pick up relevant skills. Whether you are a total beginner, a non-CS student, or an immediate levels AI engineer, you can find suitable resources matching your learning levels and pace. 

It can be daunting to navigate between loads of different resources. So I will discuss what I have gained through my journey in AI as a computer science student and what I think is worthy of your time. 

## Getting My Feet Wet with Summer Research Program 
My journey into AI all started with getting accepted to the [STAR program](https://drexel.edu/pennoni/urep/undergraduate-research/STAR-scholars/) in the freshman summer. I had the opportunity to work on a project extending from my advisor's Ph.D. thesis.  

The inspiration for this research stems from what computer scientists have been doing for a long time: developing artificial intelligence to mimic human intelligence. Artificial intelligence aims to construct a machine that can perform high-level learning tasks such as problem-solving, decision making, perception, and linguistics. According to the hierarchy of learning by Gagne (1962), high-level learning skills are built upon lower-level skills such as signal learning, stimulus-response, and chaining [1](#references). In the paper published in 1962, Stuart argued that it is crucial to produce a system capable of performing low-level learning in natural intelligence to develop a machine capable of high-level intelligence [2](#references). He proposed the "cybernetic automation" model to mimic some low-level learning abilities found in nature.

In my research project, I reproduced and examined the results of the cybernetic automaton published by Stuart (1956) on four basic stimulus-response learning skills: (1) classical conditioning, (2) extinction of classical conditioning, (3) latent inhibition, (4) instrumental learning. Then, I compared the results of the cybernetic automaton to the prominent studies on animals and humans published by psychologists.

## Hackathons are More Than Fun
The next step in my journey is building projects using machine learning techniques. 

I attended a few hackathons and built projects using the latest machine learning techniques and tools. We don't build the whole model from scratch but rather use pre-trained machine learning models, which are trained on big datasets by experts in the field and have high accuracy. 

Projects are fun.

## Research Labs
Research labs are similar to the summer program but for a longer period of time. I've got to know the latest research areas in the field. 

What you will learn depends on the focus of the lab.  

## Online Certificates Are Not Enough.
The homework and quizzes are not that demanding, and you barely push yourself to understand everything in the video lectures. 

Certificates are quick ways to learn new tools. 
I quickly grasp the concepts of ANN, CNN, and ABC. I also pick up TensorFlow, a framework for AI development. 

Certificates are accessible.
The best advantage of an online certificate is that it's accessible. Many tech companies offer courses on their tools. For example, Google offers courses on Google cloud, Amazon offers AWS training courses, and IBM has their engineers offering AI courses.

However, online certificates are not enough to understand the fundamentals and how the math works behind AI. 

## College Courses are Fundamentals
College classes provide the fundamentals and consolidate what I've learned before. Homeworks, quizzes, and tests push me to understand everything. 

I've to wait till the third year to take the first course in AI. 

You will do basic maths that the online courses don't offer you. You will calculate the pooling, gradient descent, or ABC. 

I just took 3 undergraduate classes in AI/ML and felt like I touched the tip of the AI/ML iceberg. 

## Final Thoughts
There're many resources to learn AI/ML. Your choice depends on your current understanding of AI/ML, interest, and career plan. There're many career paths, such as machine learning engineers, data engineers, AI researchers, etc. 

If you are a CS first-year student, you don't need to wait until your second or third year to learn about AI. You can start a new project to explore AI applications that would help you to sneak a peak at how AI applies in the real world. Or you can attend a hackathon to build an AI application. Hackathon is a great opportunity to work with others. You will not only learn about applying AI but also about software development.
