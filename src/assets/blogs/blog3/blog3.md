In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a hot domain that draws lots of attention from researchers and investors. From 2010 to 2021, the total number of AI publications doubled, growing from 162,444 in 2010 to 334,497 in 2021. The industry also sees a similar trend as a lot of money has been pouring into AI-related businesses. In 2020, the total global investment in AI reached 67.9 billion USD, an increase of 40% compared to 2019. 

AI is a promising domain as it can help solve current problems and accelerate other non-tech industries. What excites me about AI is the potential to make things easier for humans, such as helping to predict cancer, growing more crops, and optimizing water usage. Many computer science students are excited about AI's potential and want to get their feet wet. And so am I. 

Eager to learn more about this exciting new domain, I've decided to take different initiatives: attending hackathons, volunteering in research labs, building side projects, getting online certificates, etc. While navigating my way to self-teach myself, I discover that there are tons of resources to learn the fundamentals and pick up relevant skills. Whether you are a total beginner, a non-CS student, or an immediate levels AI engineer, you can find suitable resources matching your learning levels and pace. 

It can be daunting to navigate between loads of different resources. So I will discuss what I have gained through my journey in AI as a computer science student and what I think is worthy of your time. 

## Getting My Feet Wet with Summer Research Program

*My Friends and I proudly received the Summer Research Program Certificates*

My journey into AI all started with getting accepted to the [STAR program](https://drexel.edu/pennoni/urep/undergraduate-research/STAR-scholars/) in the freshman summer. I had the opportunity to work on a project extending from my advisor's Ph.D. thesis.  

The inspiration for this research stems from what computer scientists have been doing for a long time: developing artificial intelligence to mimic human intelligence. Artificial intelligence aims to construct a machine that can perform high-level learning tasks such as problem-solving, decision making, perception, and linguistics. According to the hierarchy of learning by Gagne (1962), high-level learning skills are built upon lower-level skills such as signal learning, stimulus-response, and chaining [1](#references). In the paper published in 1962, Stuart argued that it is crucial to produce a system capable of performing low-level learning in natural intelligence to develop a machine capable of high-level intelligence [2](#references). He proposed the "cybernetic automation" model to mimic some low-level learning abilities found in nature.

In my research project, I reproduced and examined the results of the cybernetic automaton published by Stuart (1956) on four basic stimulus-response learning skills: (1) classical conditioning, (2) extinction of classical conditioning, (3) latent inhibition, (4) instrumental learning. Then, I compared the results of the cybernetic automaton to the prominent studies on animals and humans published by psychologists.

## Hackathons are More Than Fun

*User Interface of My Second Hackathon's Project*

I must say that the most fascinating and enjoyable part of my journey is learning to apply AI by attending hackathons. I've attended over 10 hackathons and built projects using the latest machine learning techniques and tools. In my second hackathon project, my team built a desktop app to help severely paralytic people speak out loud about their thoughts using their eyes and head movements. We implement a machine learning model to recognize human faces and facial features. It's wide opening to apply machine learning models to build useful mobile/web/desktop application features.

We don't build the whole model from scratch but rather use pre-trained machine learning models, which are trained on big datasets by experts in the field and have high accuracy. Everyone can try to implement machine learning models in different languages.
