In recent years, AI has become a hot domain, drawing attention from researchers and investors. From 2010 to 2021, the total number of AI publications doubled, growing from 162,444 in 2010 to 334,497 in 2021. The industry has poured a lot of money into AI. The total global investment in AI reached USD 67.9 billion in 2020, an increase of 40% compared to 2019. 

Many computer science students are excited about getting into the field, and so am I. What excites me about AI/ML is the potential to make things easier for humans. AI can help predict cancer, grows more crops, and optimize water usage. 

To explore AI, I've attended hackathons, done research, built side projects, and studied for certificates. There are tons of resources where you can learn about AI, whether you are a total beginner, a non-CS student, or an immediate levels AI engineer. To help you navigate the pools of different resources, I will discuss what I have gained through different activities and what I think is worthy of your time. 

## Summer Research Program
My journey into AI all started with getting accepted to the STAR programs in the freshman summer. I had the opportunity to work on my professor's Ph.D. thesis. 

The research is not about the latest research in AI but rather an alternative model for artificial intelligence in simulating intelligence. 

I learned to read research papers in computer science and psychology. 

AI is not about machine learning. 

## Hackathons & Projects
The next step in my journey is building projects using machine learning techniques. 

I attended a few hackathons and built projects using the latest machine learning techniques and tools. We don't build the whole model from scratch but rather use pre-trained machine learning models, which are trained on big datasets by experts in the field and have high accuracy. 

Projects are fun.

## Research labs
Research labs are similar to the summer program but for a longer period of time. I've got to know the latest research areas in the field. 

What you will learn depends on the focus of the lab.  

## Coursera Certificates are not enough
The homework and quizzes are not that demanding, and you barely push yourself to understand everything in the video lectures. 

Certificates are quick ways to learn new tools. 
I quickly grasp the concepts of ANN, CNN, and ABC. I also pick up TensorFlow, a framework for AI development. 

Certificates are accessible.
The best advantage of an online certificate is that it's accessible. Many tech companies offer courses on their tools. For example, Google offers courses on Google cloud, Amazon offers AWS training courses, and IBM has their engineers offering AI courses.

However, online certificates are not enough to understand the fundamentals and how the math works behind AI. 

## College Courses
College classes provide the fundamentals and consolidate what I've learned before. Homeworks, quizzes, and tests push me to understand everything. 

I've to wait till the third year to take the first course in AI. 

You will do basic maths that the online courses don't offer you. You will calculate the pooling, gradient descent, or ABC. 

I just took 3 undergraduate classes in AI/ML and felt like I touched the tip of the AI/ML iceberg. 

## Final thoughts
There're many resources to learn AI/ML. What you choose depends on your current understanding of AI/ML, interest, and career plan. There're many career paths, such as machine learning engineers, data engineers, AI researchers, etc. 

If you are a CS first-year student, you don't need to wait until your second or third year to learn about AI. You can start a new project to explore AI applications that would help you to sneak a peak at how AI applies in the real world. Or you can attend a hackathon to build an AI application. Hackathon is a great opportunity to work with others. You will not only learn about applying AI but also about software development.
