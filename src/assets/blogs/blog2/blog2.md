# Lessons Learned from 7 Hackathon Win
Published: Aug 1st, 2022

## Lesson 1: It's ok to contribute the smallest effort to your group project

During my first three hackathon, I tried my best to contribute. Though, there's a moment I feel like I didn't contribute much to the team, and I wish I could code better, sleep less, and make more contribution. However, after the next projects, I become more involved and was able to contribute more than my first hakathons. 

## Lesson 2: Preparing can make big difference 

## Lesson 3: Sleep well

## Lesson 4: It is totally OK to not win anything.
