In my first year, I registered for a 1-credit course for the undergraduate research lab. I later had the opportunity to attend the [Micro Air Vehicle Student Challenge (MAV) 2020](https://vtol.org/education/micro-air-vehicle-student-challenge/micro-air-vehicle-student-challenge-2019) hosted by the Vertical Flight Society. Looking back, I believe that participating in this course was the best choice I made in my first year at Drexel. What's more exciting was that our research group received the Honorable Mention Award for the best remotely-controlled target search aircraft in this competition ðŸš€ . I gained many valuable knowledge and skills and made new friends during these 6 months. In this blog, I want to share my experience attending the competition.

## Building Drones in 6 Months: Testing and Failing

Our team built multiple prototypes of drones within 6 months. We designed, fixed, and assembled the drone again every time we failed. There are three main subteams: mechanical, control, and sensing. The mechanical was responsible for designing and 3D-printed the drone frames. The control team soldered electronic parts, integrated them into the frames, and configured the software to make the drones fly. The sensing team worked on incorporating the camera systems onto the drone. In the first few months, I worked with the control team to learn to solder electric wires, use drone configuration software, and build everything from scratch. Throughout the process, we burned a few batteries and broke a few pieces of hardware. 

In the last few months, the team recruited new members, and I led the control team to ensure that the drones could fly and be remotely controlled. The biggest trouble was that the drones were not stable. No matter how hard we tried, the drones kept crashing. The primary struggle was that our team comprised first-year students without experience building drones. Luckily, we were mentored by an amazing professor and senior students who were also building drones for their senior projects. The drones were able to fly around and carry the package.

## Rushing to Make it To MAV 2019

Because most of the teammates were freshmen, we spent months learning the basics. So when we knew that we got selected to be the finalists, there were only a few months left while many tasks were yet to be done. The team rushed to make the design presentation, record a flight demo, and try mimicking the package delivery mission. The most challenging part was controlling the drone to avoid several obstacles between the home base and the drop-off/pickup area.

## Final thoughts

We finally presented our design in front of the judges from VFS. Unfortunately, our drones didn't take off due to some technical issues on the day of competing for the delivery mission. It was sad that we ran into this problem right before the competition. However, all members are happy with what we have learned.

MAV 2019 was the first time I competed in a robotics competition. It was so fascinating that I later became more interested in robotics and machine learning. During 6 months of building drones, I learned to work with many students from different majors and even had a chance to lead the control team. As an international student, it was eye-opening to work with the newest technology in the research lab and see other teams from different colleges competing.
