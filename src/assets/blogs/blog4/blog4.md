In my freshman year, I registered for the undergraduate research lab and had the opportunity to attend the Micro Air Vehicle Student Challenge (MAV) hosted by the Vertical Flight Society. 

## Building Drones in 6 Months

The struggle is that our team mostly comprises of freshman who have no experience building drones. Luckily, we are mentored by an amazing professor and senior students who also building drones for their senior projects.  

## Testing and Failing

We 3D-printed the drone frames and integrated the electronics parts into. 

We burned a few batteries and broke a few hardwares. 

## My responsibilities
In the first few months, I learned to solder electric wires, learned how to use drone configuration softwares, and how to build drones from scratch.

In the last few months, I lead the control team to make sure that the drones can fly. 

The biggest trouble is that the drones are not stable. No matter how hard we tries, the drones keep crashing and still uncontrollable.
