As the academic year 2021-2022 has come to an end, I'm excited to finish my year serving as the president of the Drexel Women in Computing Society (WiCS). Drexel WiCS is the official chapter of ACM-W. Our mission is to support women-identifying people in computing fields and students interested in technology. The ultimate goal is to empower women in technology fields to succeed and thrive in the Drexel community and beyond. In 2022, we expanded our leadership board by 50% and organized 40+ events and initiatives. 

Looking back at the whole journey with WiCS, I'm proud that the community has grown strongly. I'm motivated to work with amazing student leaders and get to know new friends. 

## Don't be afraid to initiate new things

As I received the position, I've tons of ideas to implement to help my organization grow. However, at the same time, I wondered if it would work or doesn't work as I expected. I was initially hesitating about these ideas but later decided to implement them. Yes, some changes didn't have the impact I expected; nonetheless, some other ideas did work out. 

It was quite intimidating at the beginning when the school returned to in-person after spending a whole year doing virtual events. However, our team expanded from 20 to 30 leaders, including executives, directors, and chairs. We divided into 7 committees to plan and organize initiatives focusing on different areas: diversity & inclusion, finance, marketing & public relations, membership, mentorship, professional development, and technical. 

As the leader of your organization, you might have some ideas to help the board communicate better. So don't be afraid to try out those different ideas. You can implement it to see the impact. You can always ask your members about their feelings.

## You're the Calendar
I can vividly remember that former president told me that that president would act like the calendar to ensure everything was on track. 

By learning to keep track of student organizations, I have become better at my time management skill. 

## Conflicts are healthy for organizations
I think that conflicts can be beneficial, and handling those conflicts can help your organization run smoothly. 

## Solving problems: Get Ready for Plan B
The most important lesson I learned is how to address conflict, people who are lacking behind, or unresponsive members. I believe that there's not a single perfect team that can work well together.

## Final thoughts

The last thing I learned from my experience is to enjoy your time hosting events, making friends, and getting to know other organizations. It was interactive and ABC to go beyond the Zoom meeting to finally meet my friends again. 

I hope you enjoy learning about my experience as the president of a student organization. I want to admit that I somewhat regret not having time to accomplish some initiatives initially.  

If you're a student looking to grow and learn new things, don't hesitate to join the leadership board of the organization you're interested in.
