As the academic year 2021-2022 has come to an end, I'm excited to finish my year serving as the president of the Drexel Women in Computing Society (WiCS). Drexel WiCS is the official chapter of ACM-W. Our mission is to support women-identifying people in computing fields and students interested in technology. The ultimate goal is to empower women in technology fields to succeed and thrive in the Drexel community and beyond. 

In 2022, we expanded our leadership board by 50% and organized 40+ events and initiatives. We hosted various events, notably the student career spotlight panel, salary negotiation workshop, Arduino workshop, AI/ML research panel, and boba social event. This year, we continue the three mentorship programs - Alumni & Professional Mentorship, Technical Mentorship, and Peer Mentorship - that pair over 100 students with mentors for learning and networking. 

Looking back at my journey with WiCS, I'm proud that the community has grown strongly and supported our members' social, academic, and professional development. I'm motivated to work with amazing student leaders and get to know new friends. On top of that, I've gained valuable leadership skills. 

## Turn Ideas To Impact: From Insecure to Confident

When I received the position, my mind was overflowing with ideas and strategies to help the organization operate more efficiently. However, at the same time, I doubted if the new initiatives would work. I initially hesitated about these ideas. After consulting with my vice-president and doing some research, I decided to execute some of them. Yes, some changes didn't have the impact I expected; nonetheless, some other ideas did work out. 

The first initiative was expanding our leadership board and having a clear organizational structure. Our team expanded from 20 to 30 leaders, including executives, directors, and chairs. We divided into 7 committees to plan and organize initiatives focusing on different areas: diversity & inclusion, finance, marketing & public relations, membership, mentorship, professional development, and technical. Throughout the year, we were able to host a diverse range of events and initiatives. 

I learn that the strategy is to learn from other success stories and constantly listen to the members. I have worked in a few organizations and know these strategies work with them. I consulted the vice-president to discuss adopting new management methods. I later asked members what they thought about the new changes. I met one member at one event, and she said she found it helpful to understand different areas WiCS is working on. 

## Coping with Deadlines: Understand your Team and Prioritize Mental Health

The most challenging part of managing an organization is constantly keeping track of deadlines. It is challenging because our team is a student organization, and we prioritize classes and coops before clubs. I can vividly remember that former president told me that that president would act like the calendar to ensure everything was on track. I'm trying to provide all the necessary help when I'm available. Also, I remind people ahead and give flexible deadlines. 

By learning to keep track of student organizations, I have become better at my time management skill. 

## Conflicts are Healthy for Organizations
I think that conflicts can be beneficial, and handling those conflicts can help your organization run smoothly. 

## Solving problems: Get Ready for Plan B
The most important lesson I learned is how to address conflict, people who are lacking behind, or unresponsive members. I believe that there's not a single perfect team that can work well together.

## Final thoughts

The last thing I learned from my experience is to enjoy your time hosting events, making friends, and getting to know other organizations. It was interactive and ABC to go beyond the Zoom meeting to finally meet my friends again. 

I hope you enjoy learning about my experience as the president of a student organization. I want to admit that I somewhat regret not having time to accomplish some initiatives initially. 

If you're a student looking to grow and learn new things, don't hesitate to join the leadership board of the organization you're interested in.
