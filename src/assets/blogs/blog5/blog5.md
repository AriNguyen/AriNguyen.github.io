As I'm finishing my junior year at Drexel, I'm grateful to have the opportunity to serve as the president of the Drexel Women in Computing Society (WiCS). I've joined WiCS and have grown with the organization since my freshman year. I've met the most talented and empowered women who are passionate about promoting diversity in tech and helping others succeed. I've worked with the most outstanding student leaders who have taught me valuable lessons. 

WiCS is the official chapter of ACM-W. Our mission is to support women-identifying people in computing fields and students interested in technology. The ultimate goal is to empower women in technology fields to succeed and thrive in the Drexel community and beyond. In 2022, we expanded our leadership board by 50% and organized more than 40 events and initiatives. We hosted various events, notably the student career spotlight panel, salary negotiation workshop, Arduino workshop, AI/ML research panel, and boba social event. This year, we continue the three mentorship programs - Alumni & Professional Mentorship, Technical Mentorship, and Peer Mentorship - that pair over 100 students with mentors for learning and networking. 

Looking back at my journey with WiCS, I'm proud that the community has grown strongly and supported our members' social, academic, and professional development. I'm motivated to work with amazing student leaders and get to know new friends. On top of that, I've gained valuable leadership skills. In this blog, I will share what I've learned from Being the President of A Student Organization. 

## Turn Ideas To Impact: From Insecure to Confident

When I received the position, my mind was overflowing with ideas and strategies to help the organization operate more efficiently. However, at the same time, I doubted if the new initiatives would work. I initially hesitated about these ideas. After consulting with my vice-president and doing some research, I decided to execute some of them. Yes, some changes didn't have the impact I expected; nonetheless, some other ideas did work out. 

The first initiative was expanding our leadership board and having a clear organizational structure. Our team expanded from 20 to 30 leaders, including executives, directors, and chairs. We divided into 7 committees to plan and organize initiatives focusing on different areas: diversity & inclusion, finance, marketing & public relations, membership, mentorship, professional development, and technical. Throughout the year, we were able to host a diverse range of events and initiatives. 

I learn that the strategy is to learn from other success stories and constantly listen to the members. I have worked in a few organizations and know these strategies work with them. I consulted the vice-president to discuss adopting new management methods. I later asked members what they thought about the new changes. I met one member at one event, and she said she found it helpful to understand different areas WiCS is working on. 

## Coping with Deadlines: Understand your Team and Prioritize Mental Health

The most challenging part of managing an organization is to constantly keep track of deadlines. There are many responsibilities, from applying for funds to recruiting new members to ensure events are well planned. So I made use of Google Calendar and weekly notes to remind teammates ahead of time and give flexible deadlines. I also tried to be responsive and provide all the necessary help when available. 

Our team is a student organization, and we all know to prioritize classes and coops before clubs. I didn't want to pressure or create stress among all members, so I let everyone know the expected time commitment and responsibilities. I sometimes checked in with members on the amount of work and recruited chairs if there were many duties. 

By learning to lead my student organizations, I have improved my time management and team management skills. I have learned to manage my schedule efficiently, delegate tasks, and prioritize my mental health. 

## Healthy Conflicts are for Healthy Organizations

The second lesson I learned is that conflicts can be beneficial for an organization to run smoothly. Disagreement, unmet expectations, and misunderstanding are inevitable to all groups, teams, and organizations. The conversation to address these tensions is difficult because one member might hold on to some type of bitterness or put up with the same problem over and over again. That used to be me. I tended to hold back out of fear of hurting a relationship, hurting other feelings, and just not wanting to say the wrong thing. I've learned how to address when teammates are lacking behind or unresponsive to emails or texts. I believe that there's not a single perfect team that can work well together.

The last thing I want to share is to enjoy your time hosting events, making friends, and getting to know other organizations. It was amazing to go beyond the Zoom meeting to finally meet my friends again this school year. I hope you enjoy learning about my experience leading a student organization. If you're a student looking to grow and learn new things, don't hesitate to join the leadership board of the organization you're interested in. It's super rewarding!
