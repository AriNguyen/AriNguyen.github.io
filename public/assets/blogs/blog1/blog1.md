I didn't know what a hackathon was until seeing someone winning their first place award on LinkedIn. I didn't know how to code before college and hadn't built any projects at that time. I get motivated to attend a hackathon and win something when I see people sharing their winning experiences on LinkedIn. 

So I took the initiative, packed my 2017 Macbook and some clothes, and took the train to my first hackathon in New Jersey. I was a little bit scared cause it was my first time participating in a hackathon. Though it seems like I stepped out of my comfort zone, I chose to go to a hackathon for women as my comfort treat. 

## My First Hackathon
In my first hackathon, I got into a room of strangers and talked to each other, trying to form a group. I later formed a group of 4 people, and we came up with the idea of building a machine learning application detecting ripe avocados with a motivation to reduce food waste. 

## The First Hackathon Win
YESSSS, I won the first hackathon in my second time attending the hackathon. I paired up with my friends this time and took the train to New Jersey to attend HackRU 2019, hosted by Rutgers University. We brainstormed a lot of cool, crazy, and fun ideas. It was the brainstorming step that led to the first hackathon award.

The inspiration of this project is to help people living with paralysis communicate. Inspired to help these people make a normal conversation, we created a desktop app to help severely paralytic people speak out loud about their thoughts using their eyes and head movements.

## The Second Hackathon Win
In our second hackathon win, we built a rover that simulates a smart wheelchair for people living with paralysis. We took the opportunity to visit our friends at Penn State University. It was so nice meeting new friends and winning the second hackathon award.

## The "Yummy" Hackathon
One of the most memorable hackathons is Hoya Hacks at Georgetown University, Washington DC. We didn't win anything but enjoyed building things and the best ramen ever, JINYA Ramen Bar. It's a must-try!

## My Latest and Most-Proud Hackathon Win
I got my latest hackathon award, 1st Place Overall and Best Hack for Social Good, in the most recent hackathon DragonHacks 2021, hosted by Drexel IEEE. 

Our project is to build an interactive game to learn American Sign Language (ASL). We implemented transfer learning, a machine learning technique, in image classification tasks using Python, OpenCV, and Tensorflow. The program can recognize 29 classes of hand gestures.

## Lessons Learned from Attending 10+ hackathons
- It is totally OK to not win anything. 
- Learning a new tech stack and meeting and working with others is the most important.
- You can take advantage of attending a hackathon to work on what you're passionate about and care about.
