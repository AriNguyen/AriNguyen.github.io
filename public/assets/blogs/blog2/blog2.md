## The reason I write this blog
At the time I'm writing this blog, I'm a rising senior computer science student and starting to apply for software engineering new grad jobs. 
A bit about myself: I didn't know how to code before college and wanted to build projects to polish my resume for coops and internships. While looking back on my journey in the tech field and deciding what to put in my resume, I see that participating in hackathons is the most brilliant decision I've made. I've learned a lot of new things, from acquiring new tech stacks to working as a team to build a product. 

If you didn't know about hackathons, I highly recommend you read my previous blog about my experience attending 14 hackathons. I highly recommend attending one hackathon. 

If you're reading this blog now, I guess most of you already know what a hackathon is and wants to ace your next hackathon. No further due, I'm going to share with you the most important lessons I learned after participating in 14 hackathons. 

## Lesson 1: Preparing can make a big difference 
Because you only have 24 to 48 hours to build a product, it's hard to pick up a new programming language and be able to finish your project on time. One strategy is to pick up the skills ahead of time quickly. You don't need to learn to be proficient with the new skills.

In my 4th hackathon, our team decided to build a mobile app. Before the hackathon, I learned to use Sketch for prototyping and Java and Android Studio basics. Our team didn't have any experience building mobile apps. Still, we were able to build a basic mobile app before the hackathon. This saved us a lot of time, and we finally finished the mobile app within 24 hours and proudly demoed our project. 

I always see hackathons as opportunities to learn new things. There's no shame in not knowing anything. Your attitude towards learning new things is the most valuable.

## Lesson 2: Idea makes perfect
Brainstorming idea is important. So make sure your team has everyone involved in listing all possible ideas, and then vote for the shortlist. 

Out of all my 7 wins, I notice that they all have the purpose of social good. With my experience instructing high school kids to build a full-stack web app, I hope they can think about the app's purpose and work towards that cause. 

## Lesson 3: Taking time to sleep and rest
Most hackathons last 2 or 3 days, so taking care of your mental and physical health is crucial. 

## Lesson 4: It is totally ok not to win anything. 
I believe anyone attending hackathons all wants to win something. That is the biggest motivation that keeps us registering and spending 24 hours coding. By attending a hackathon, you go out of your comfort zone seeking new opportunities to learn and to grow. So in your first few hackathons, the most important thing is to get a sense of how attending a hackathon feels like. 

And keep in mind that it is totally ok not to win anything. It turns out that the hackathon where I learned the most was those I didn't win anything. 

There're a lot of worthy experiences besides winning. Keep in mind that software engineering is also about people, not only about the product. 
I've learned a lot by working with others to build a project. 

## Lesson 5: It's ok to contribute small efforts to your group project
During my first three hackathons, I tried my best to contribute. Though there's a moment I felt like I didn't contribute much to the team and wished I could do better for the team. However, after the following projects, I became more involved and was able to contribute more than in my first hackathon. 

If you cannot find an opportunity to go to a hackathon, you can always learn new things. You can learn on your own by building a side project, building a coursework project, or doing research. 

...

On a final note, good look with your next hackathon! I hope you will make new friends and learn something new.
